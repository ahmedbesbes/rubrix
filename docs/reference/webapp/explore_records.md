# Explore records

The **Exploration mode** turns out convenient when it comes to explore and analyze records in a dataset.

As Rubrix allows different tasks to be carried out, different visualizations are tailored for the task. For example, it is possible to see and analyze the keywords, metrics, the labels and to choose the parameters described above.

More detailed information about the features related to the **Explore mode** can be found [here](dataset.md).


## Tasks and Records

As it is known, Rubrix deals with three different types of tasks:

- **Text2Text Tasks**: In these tasks, it is possible to use the Metrics menu (on the sidebar) and to analyze the score, the prediction agent and the status, or users can also sort the results by these parameters.

- **Token Classification Tasks**: When it comes to tokenization tasks, Rubrix displays labels in a very transparent way— each label in a dataset has a different color, and their caption is displayed next to the search bar. All filters and the Metrics menu can be used.

- **Text Classification Tasks**: In this mode, it works in a very similar way to token classification tasks. The **explore mode** is specially interesting with binary models— when it comes to positive or negative annotations, their corresponding icon is displayed next to the record.

## Filters and search

Filters can be useful in order to sort and find records easily.

More information about these features can be found [here](dataset.md), and their use is described [here](filter_records.md).

More information about searching records can be found [here](search_records.md).

## Sidebar and metrics

In all modes (**Explore**, **Annotation** and **Define rules**), the **Metrics** menu is available on the sidebar. Learn more about it [here](dataset.md) (features) or [here](view_dataset_metrics.md) (an "user guide").
