# Search Records

With this component, users are able to search specific information on the dataset, either by **full-text queries** or by queries using **Elasticsearch**.

More information is available [here](searchbar.md).

## How to search

It can be done by using full-text queries (a normal search), or by Elasticsearch with its [query string syntax](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html#query-string-syntax).

In both **Annotation** and **Exploration** modes, the search bar is placed in the upper left-hand corner. To search something, users must type one or several words (or a query) and click the **Intro** button.

Note that this feature also works as a kind of filter. If users search something, it is possible to explore and/or annotate the results obtained. [Filters](filter_records.md) can be applied.
